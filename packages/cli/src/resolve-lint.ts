/**
 * Oxlint tool resolver for the vite-plus CLI.
 *
 * This module exports a function that resolves the oxlint binary path
 * using Node.js module resolution. The resolved path is passed back
 * to the Rust core, which then executes oxlint for code linting.
 *
 * Used for: `vite-plus lint` command
 *
 * Oxlint is a fast JavaScript/TypeScript linter written in Rust that
 * provides ESLint-compatible linting with significantly better performance.
