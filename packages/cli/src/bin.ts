/**
 * Entry point for the vite-plus CLI.
 *
 * This file initializes the CLI by passing JavaScript tool resolver functions
 * to the Rust core through NAPI bindings. Each resolver function is responsible
 * for locating the binary path of its respective tool using Node.js module resolution.
 *
 * The Rust core will call these functions when it needs to execute the corresponding
 * tools (e.g., when running `vite-plus build`, it calls the vite resolver).
