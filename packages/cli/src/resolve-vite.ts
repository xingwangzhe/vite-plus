/**
 * Vite tool resolver for the vite-plus CLI.

 * command and arguments.
 *
 * Used for: `vite-plus build` and potentially `vite-plus dev` commands

 *   - envs: Environment variables to set when executing Vite
 *
 * The function first tries to resolve vite package, then falls back
 * to rolldown-vite package (for direct rolldown-vite installations).
 * It constructs the path to the CLI binary within the resolved package.
